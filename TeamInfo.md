## Project Summary

DelayAware24 is an application to provide historic details of flight delays and cancellations coming from various airports. The delays and cancellations will be used to analyze the airports and airlines they originate from and then rank the airports based on this cancellation information. Users will be able to view which airports are the most timely, which have the most delays and cancellations, etc. The application will present this information in various formats, including an interactive map and analysis of the best and worst airports. The data will be based on the 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellation data and will also make use of the Google Maps API.

The application is intended to help people find better airports and air paths, especially in emergency cases where delays and cancellations would be disastrous. Similar flight tracking applications exist, however they do not focus on delays and cancellations. Our application will fill this niche, offering more in-depth information and analysis on this topic while being user-friendly.
